At Goethe University, he is also Founding Dean of the Graduate School of Economics, Finance, and Management (GSEFM), and Member of the Executive Board of the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability (IMFS).

Binder did his undergraduate coursework in economics, business administration and law at the University of Kiel, and received a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995. He has published on a variety of topics in macroeconomics and econometrics, has been recipient of the Outstanding Author Contribution Award at the Literati Network Awards for Excellence 2013, has been associate editor of the Journal of Applied Econometrics, the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, and Empirical Economics, has directed a node of a European Commission FP7 research network on macroeconomic modelling, and is currently Principal Investigator of a research project on model comparison in macroeconomics granted by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and to Goethe University Frankfurt.

Binder has also held appointments inter alia at the University of Cambridge, the University of Maryland, the University of Munich (CESifo), the University of Southern California, the Vietnamese-German University, Xiamen University, the Bank of Spain, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Binder was a Fulbright scholar, a Marie Curie research fellow, a scholar of the German National Scholarship Foundation, and has been the recipient of numerous teaching awards at the undergraduate as well as graduate levels.

Michael Binder’s current research in part examines the implications of financial market structures for business cycle dynamics, output growth and macroeconomic policy design. His research also involves the development of new econometric methods for panel data sets, and the application of these methods to cross-country studies.
